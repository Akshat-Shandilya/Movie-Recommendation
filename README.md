# Movie-Recommendation
This is a movie recommendation model that works on the concept of vectorization. I have used pandas, numpy, sklearn, ast and nltk libraries to make this model. The tags for the vectors mainly include the cast, crew, genre and overview of the movie. Most of the movies in the dataset are English movies.
